Why you would like to join Raising IT?
Tom's explanation of the company, its core values and the idea of putting my working life into a something that has a positive effect on people really appeals to me. Doing my part in helping the company's success (and its clients) using my experience and seeing that flourish is a great prospect.

Links to any account/s on GitHub/Google code etc.
- http://www.github.com/yetanotherchris is where all my open source is found, and
- http://www.github.com/roadkillwiki/ is a .NET wiki engine I maintain.

Any blogs & email groups you read or would recommend.
The C#/.NET blogs I read:

- Eric Lippert
- Jon Skeet
- Scott Hanselman
- Martin Fowler 

Generally I get links from DotnetKicks, Hacker News and /r/programming for my news. A lot of my information comes from Podcasts (.NET Rocks).

Any communities & events you attend or are involved with.
The .NET open source community on Github is something I'm fairly involved with - I've collobrated with the Nancy and NLog authors in the past, and Roadkill (the .NET wiki I look after in my spare time) gets quite a lot of community involvement.

Any technical books youâ€™ve read that stood out.
Clean Code by Bob Martin was an eye opener, something I had believed in doing already but he communicates it in a really clear way. Inside CLR is another good one (Jeffrey Richter), Mike Cohn's books on agile are amazing (Succeeding with Agile and Agile Estimating).

How do you ensure the software you build is of a high quality?
I think keeping the code clean, using established patterns and achieving as high automated test coverage (90%+) as possible are the three main pillars for well engineered and high quality code. These have proven to work for me both professionally (where we have high code coverage) and in my spare time (with Roadkill) for the last 5 years. Manual testing is also an essential part of the process in my view, particularly exploratory testing.
